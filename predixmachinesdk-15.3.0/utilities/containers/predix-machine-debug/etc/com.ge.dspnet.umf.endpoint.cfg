# [Optional. EndpointDeploymentType enum. Default to peer-to-peer. Restart endpoint for value change to take effect.]
# Deployment type of the endpoint.  Valid deployement type can be "peer-to-peer" or "star".
# When peer-to-peer is used, multicast discovery will be used.
# When star is used, announcement of this endpoint will be sent to the peers specified in the initial peers list.

# [Optional if deployment type is peer-to-peer. String. Default to "udpv4://239.255.0.1". Restart endpoint for value change to take effect.]
# [Required if deployment type is star.]
# The initial list of peers that will be contacted about the presence of this endpoint.
# One or more peers can be specified.  Separate peers with a pipe character (|), for example:
#     com.ge.dspnet.umf.endpoint.initialPeers=10.2.3.100 | tcpv4_lan://10.2.3.100:8700 | tlsv4_lan://10.2.3.100:8701

#   Configurations for communications with FCS
##############################################################

# [Optional. Boolean. Default to true. Restart endpoint for value change to take effect.]
# Whether this endpoint works with or without Fabric Configuration Service (FCS).
# An endpoint can be self-sufficient with all configurations residing locally. Or it can
# start up with minimal configurations, and pull more configurations from FCS. 
# Set value to "true" to use FCS, or "false" otherwise.
com.ge.dspnet.umf.endpoint.useFcs=false

# [Optional. Integer. Default to 0. Restart endpoint for value change to take effect. Ignored if useFcs is false.]
# In order for an endpoint to communicate with FCS, it needs to know the domain that FCS listens to.
#com.ge.dspnet.umf.endpoint.fcsDomainId=0

# [Required if useFcs is true. String. No default. Restart endpoint for value change to take effect. Ignored if useFcs is false.]
# FCS uses matching criteria to determine what configuration settings are needed for a particular endpoint.
#
# Separate property values with the pipe (|) character
#     name1=value1|name2=value2|...
# And FCS locates configuration files for this endpoint using directory path like "value1/value2/..." and thus
# sequence of name-value pairs is important.
#
# For example, the following match criteria
#     Type=umfapps|App=publish
# translates to the following directory path
#     umfapps/publish

# [Optional. TransportType enum. Default to "udpv4". Restart endpoint for value change to take effect. Ignored if useFcs is false.]

# Specify the protocol(s) to use for discovering FCS. Valid protocols can be udpv4, udpv6, tcp, tls, dtls.
# One or more protocol(s) can be specified. Separate protocols with a pipe-character (|), for example
#    com.ge.dspnet.umf.endpoint.fcsDiscoveryTransports="udpv4|tcp".
# If secured protocol (tls or dtls) is used, make sure the property securityConfigFile is specified and valid.

# [Optional. TransportType enum. Default to "udpv4". Restart endpoint for value change to take effect. Ignored if useFcs is false.]
# Specify the protocol(s) to use for data transfer between endpoint and FCS. Valid protocols can be udpv4, udpv6, tcp, tls, dtls.
# One or more protocol(s) can be specified. Separate protocols with a pipe-character (|), for example

# [Optional. Integer. Default to 8401. Restart endpoint for value change to take effect. Ignored if useFcs is false.]

#com.ge.dspnet.umf.endpoint.fcsTcpServerBindPort=8401

# [Optional. Integer. Default to 8501. Restart endpoint for value change to take effect. Ignored if useFcs is false.]

# [Optional. Relative path from where the endpoint is started. Default to "../config". Ignored if useFcs is false. Value pushed down by FCS is ignored.]
# Location where configuration files received from FCS should be saved. This location must be on classpath.
# This property is only meant for standalone endpoints. Configuration file location for OSGi endpoints are determined by the OSGi container.

# When secured protocol (TLS and/or DTLS) is used for discovery or data transfer, more configurations and security certificates are needed.
# These configurations and security entities should be stored in a secured folder where access is restricted.
# Specify the location of this secure folder.  For example,

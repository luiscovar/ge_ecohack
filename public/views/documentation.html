			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>At Cal State Fullerton, electricity is supplied from three sources: three solar panels, a trigeneration plant from our campus, and Southern California Edison (SCE). Based on our data, the campus would produce more environmental-friendly energy if there are additional solar panels and batteries. We have also proved that the campus saves money by using power from the trigeneration plant and selling that power to SCE. The campus also uses a small amount of power from SCE. Based on our resources, our application allows users to track data,  and based on our analysis it helps in managing power consumption. It provides us with the percentage of power consumption for each power source on campus. Also it provides us with the best time slots for the maintenance based on real time data of the Trigeneration plant. In addition, this study provides the potential for environment friendly and economic power source planning.</p>
			<p>By increasing the efficient use of the Trigeneration plant on campus, we provided recommendations to decrease the consumption of high pressure natural gas. The decrease in consumption of natural gas will reduce monetary cost and carbon emission on our campus
for the school in order to power the Trigeneration plant. The application also displays the Trigeneration plant downtime, and the increase in SCE import due to this downtime. The analysis of seasonal changes and downtime costs provides an opportunity for prediction of maintenance.</p>
